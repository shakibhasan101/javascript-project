# javascript-project
I am making this project by taking help from the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerdGm-ehJQ&t=13468s. 

I know the basic of coding like c programming, Java, and a little bit javascript as well. But I am not expert in java yet(07,oct,2025).

# Function

In a project it is very best practice to use returing value instead of global variable. 
# 08 Objects

## two types of notations
1. dot notation 
2. bracket notation

##  two built in objects
1. JSON
2. localStorage
### JSON
- Json doesn't support signle quotation and functions.
- it is similer to js object syntx but has less features.
